System Requirement
------------------

- Unity 5.4 or later

Performance
-----------

*Slitscan* is quite GPU intensive despite its simpleness. Especially, it spends
a lot of video memory to store frame history. For example, if the screen
resolution is set to 1920x1080, it allocates about 300 MiB of video memory.

Also it increases draw call count (about 30 draws). Thus, it may cause a
performance hit on the CPU side in some cases.
